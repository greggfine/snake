TODO:

IMPORTANT:

*** When a wrong note is hit, it should turn red or
    we should get some visual indication of being wrong.
    Vice versa for when a correct note is hit.
*** The note names should always be in view on the game board.
*** When we hit the "Start Game" button, we should get a countdown
    timer before the snake starts moving. Or: clicking one
        of the arrow keys should start the game.

*** We need to either generate arrays for all scales or
        work out formulas to generate them.
*** Instructions: the user needs to understand how to play the game.
*** The drone should be a full chord (so that we can
    hear the ref pitches against it)

CUSTOMIZATIONS:

Allow the user to set a couple of speed levels.
Modes: on each round, a random mode should be given or
    we should allow the user to pick a mode to work on.
